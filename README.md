**Paper Title:**
Predicting Workplace Conflict Through an Intersectional Multilevel Framework: An Application of I-MAIHDA
**Summary:**
This study applies the Intersectional Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (I-MAIHDA) framework to predict workplace conflict. Using survey data, the authors employ Bayesian ordinal multilevel models to analyze how intersecting social identities—including gender, birth country, position, sexuality, and disability—shape conflict risk. The results demonstrate that conflict risk varies significantly across intersectional groups, revealing systemic inequalities that are often missed by traditional single-axis analyses.
